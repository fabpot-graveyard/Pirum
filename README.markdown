Pirum, the simple PEAR Channel Server Manager
=============================================

Pirum is a simple and nice looking PEAR channel server manager that lets you
setup PEAR channel servers in a matter of minutes. Pirum is best suited when
you want to create small PEAR channels for a few packages written by a few
developers.

Pirum consists of just one file: a command line tool written in PHP. There are
no external dependencies, no need for a database, and nothing needs to be
installed or configured.
